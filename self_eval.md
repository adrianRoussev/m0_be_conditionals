# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? when you have multiple paths that could be taken depending on the input
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? I would have started with testing all my answers in replit, even the easy ones. 
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? self-learning and resolving my own errors. I think this is the most effective way of learning because it allows for you to problem solve and learn to not repeat your own mistakes.
